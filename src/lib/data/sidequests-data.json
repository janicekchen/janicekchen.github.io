They can also kill you if the water is poopy: clams eat by filtering nutrients out of the water that they take in and push out via two valves. This map is powered by a Raspberry Pi that runs a script to process daily water toxicity and tide data, and updates the color of LEDs depending on the clammability of a particular location. I talked about this project at NACIS 2023.",
